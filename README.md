# Privacy-Policy-Prompt-Unity
Sweet little package which provide the "Privacy Policy" and "Terms and Conditions" dialog, Since Google Play Store Requires that the app shows privacy policy to the user from within the app itself, I created this package to speed up this work.<br><br>
<B>Setup</B><br>
<ol>
  <li>Import the package</li>
  <li>Navigate to Scenes > PrivacyPolicyPrompt</li>
  <li>Open scene and find SceneHandler GameObject</li>
  <li>You will find SceneHandler Script attach to it</li>
  <li>In the Inspector just type in your privacy policy and terms and conditions url</li>
</ol><br>
  That's it.<br><br>
  Feel free to use it in your projects whether it is commercial or non-commercial.
  You don't even have to credit me either, however I'd love it if you do.<br>
  
  <B>Note</B>
  This package does not contain any "Privacy Policy" and/or "Terms and Conditions" templates.
